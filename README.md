# Starter setup for Express with TypeScript
  TypeScript has an edge over Javascript due to its typed nature, there is enough motivation to use TypeScript in the JS based projects. Statistically, it has been observed that using TypeScript can eliminate 20%-30% of bugs compared to JS. Therefore, there are good reasons to use TypeScript in node projects as well.
  
  This project includes basic typescript and linting setup for the Express App. Further configurations can be added at will. This repository is a good starter point and can be utilised as a starter template.

## Getting Started
 * `yarn` OR `npm install` -  Install dependencies
 * `yarn dev` OR `npm run dev` - Starts the app in watch mode
